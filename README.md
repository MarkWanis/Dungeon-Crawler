This project is a text-based dungeon crawler RPG where the player battles through multiple floors of enemies, earning gold and experience to upgrade weapons, armor, and consumables. Combat is turn-based and includes elemental effects like fire, ice, poison, electric, and sleep, each with unique advantages and drawbacks. The game features shops between floors for buying items and equipment, progressive story narration, and leveling mechanics that enhance player stats. With color-coded health and dynamic enemy behavior, the program creates an immersive and strategic adventure that blends combat, resource management, and progression through increasingly difficult dungeon levels.
